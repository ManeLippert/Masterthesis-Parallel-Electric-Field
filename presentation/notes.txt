MOTIVATION

- Plasma beta is one of the fundamental dimensionless parameters in plasma physics
- Kinetic Models 
- Numerical approach needed due to partial differential equations
	-> numerical problems concerning the plasma beta in local and global simulations
- Cancellation Problem
	-> low plasma beta
	-> greater perpendicular wave vectors kperp
	-> New mitigation technique in global nonlinear simulations

Is it possible to mitigate the cancellation problem in local gyrokinetic simulations with the introduction of a new field equation?

- Talk about mitigation technique and what was previous done and how it will be done now

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CHARGED PARTICLE MOTION

- Lorentz Force

 	-> Circular Motion with Larmor Radius and Cyclotron Frequency
	-> Direction of Circulation depends on charge	
	-> Thermal Quantities rho and vth

- Coulumb Force

	-> Should be known

- Inhomogenous magnetic field 

	-> Explain Mirror Effect or just mention it 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DRIFT MOTION

- E Ã— B Drift

	-> Same directions for every carge

- Grad B/Curvature Drift

	-> Direction depends on charge (charge in equation)
	-> Curvature vector can be transfromed into gradient B vector for plasma pressure small compared to magnetic field strength

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PLASMA BETA

- Plasma Beta
	-> fusion rate ~ beta^2
	-> bootstrap fraction ~ beta
	-> MHD Stability
	-> Confinement quality of a fusion device (explain later)
- Electromagnetic fields vanish for beta -> 0
	-> Indicator for electromagentic effects in gyrokinetic systems


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ORDERING

- Low frequency: frequency of fluctuation smaller than the cyclotron frequency
- Anisotropy: Length scales of turbulence (caracterized by wave vector k) in parallel direction is significant smaller than perpendicular direction (to the ambient magnetic field).
- Strong Magnetization: Larmor radius is small compared to the gradient lengths of density, temperature and magnetic field
- Small fluctuation: perturbation of the gyrocenter distribution function is small compared to the background distribution function

- epsilion small parameter
	-> for GKW it is rho_star 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DERIVATION

- Fundamental one form -> Time integral over the langrangian
- Particle phase space -> guiding center (coordinate transformation) -> gyrocenter (perturbations of the guiding center)
	-> potentials gets seperated in equilibrium and perturbated part which gets 
	   seperated into an gyroaveraged (circle integral over theta) and oscillated part
- Vlasov Equation 
- v_chi = drift motion due to potentials and magnetic field
- v_D = drift due to curvature, zentrifugal, coriolis


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FIELDS

- Maxwell system
	-> Coulumbs law gets replaced with quasi neutrality condition
- Particle density and current expressed with moments of distribution function
- Pullback to use gyrocenter distribution instead of guiding center
	-> Correction term describes the polarization and magnetization of the fluctuation of the gyro orbit
- Moments of distribution for the guiding center distribution
	-> Delta function ensures that all particle which gyro orbit intersects at x will be counted into the particel density at x
	-> Correction term will vanish due to the point symmetry of the vpar F_M
- Fields equation
	-> Coulomb's law -> Electrostatic potential
	-> Peprendicular Ampere's law -> Magnetic compression
	-> Parallel Ampere's law -> Parallel Vector Potential
		-> Imporant for this work -> Here the equation (normalized and fft)
		-> Note the dependence of the equation because of beta

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CANCELLATION PROBLEM

- Gyrokinetc Equation again
	-> Two time derivative in PDE not trivial solvable with Runge Kutta
	-> Replace F with g (IMPORTANT Say that Apar term is the Apar correction)
	-> Gyrokinetic equations changed (Nonlinear terms and Time derivative)
- Amperes Law gets adjusted with the so called skin term
- Describe Cancellation Problem (analytically vs numerical)
- Error scall with beta/k^2

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FARADAY'S LAW

- Faradays law defined as ...
- time derivative gets replaced with RHS plus the Epar Correction term
- Normalized and FFT Equation
- New changes to the gyrokinetic equation
- Implementation
	-> Input Switch nlepar (could be changed later an)
	-> Explain flow diagramm (make clear that the f-version has to be backed in the g-version)
	-> Do not forget to recall the definition of Apar Correct and Epar Correct
	-> Motivate the decesion to calculated Fraday's law seperate
-Benchmark
	-> Hamada coordinates (Psi radial, Zeta binormal, s filed aligned)
	-> CBC with Kinetic electrons und maximum at kperp 0.3
	-> Good agreement between g-version and f-version (10% more runtime)
	   - gamma and omega for the most dominate mode of the turbulence
	   - ITG Ion temperature gradient mode
	   - TEM Trapped electron mode
	   - KBM Kinetic balloning mode
	-> Benchmark show that Epar does align well with Apar (+ Evolution)
- Mitigation
	-> Mitigation only in local linear simulations tested and does not work
	-> Two differnet testcases used
	-> Explanation 
		- Only in Global nonlinear simulations possible mitigation like in the disseration
		- Electrostatic potential gets calculated with an analytical gamma function (numerical scheme has to be everywhere the same)
		- Ampere's law (g-version) same structure as Faraday's law (f-version) 
		- Comparision between terms does not help

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CONCLUSION

- Local linear f-version sucessfully implemented
	-> Nonlinear version runs as well with same results
- Benchmark of the nonlinear is not completed yet
- Future sight: Groundwork for the global f-version done
