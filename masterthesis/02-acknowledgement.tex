First, I would like to extend my greatest gratitude to my supervisors Prof. Arthur Peeters and Dr. Florian Rath. I would like to thank both of you for your guidance and support during the writing process of this thesis. \bigskip

I would like to thank René Meißner for the access to the festus cluster and Markus Hilt for the great technical support. \bigskip

Also, I would like to thank my best friend, Paul Schwanitz, for his support in many situations and the good discussions in- and outside of academia. In addition, I would like to thank Anna-Maria Pleyer and Fabian Eller for the great time of sharing the office together. \bigskip

I thank my sister Cornelia Lippert for proofreading this thesis, which shows me that I still have to improve my English spelling. \bigskip

Outside of academia, I would like to extend my gratitude to my parents, my brother, his wife and daughter, my sister and my girlfriend for their encouragement, endurance and support while writing this thesis.
