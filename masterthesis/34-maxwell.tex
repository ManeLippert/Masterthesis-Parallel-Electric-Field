\section{Maxwell's Equations}
\label{sec:maxwellEquations}

To obtain a closed system the Vlasov equation gets combined with the Maxwell equations to calculate the perturbated electromagnetic fields. As usual in fusion plasma the Coulomb law gets replaced by the quasi neutrality condition which implies that any deviation from neutrality can only happen on small length scales within the Debye length and on a timescale much shorter than of the fluctuations. Due to the non-relativistic timescale of the turbulence the displacement current in Ampere's law is neglected as well. Taking everything into account the Maxwell's equations can be written as
\begin{gather}
	\begin{aligned}
		\spec{\sum} \spec{Z} e \, \spec{n} &= 0  &\qquad \nabla \times \vect{E}_1 &= - \frac{\partial \vect{B}_1}{\Dt}\\
		\nabla \cdot \vect{B}_1 &= 0 &\qquad \nabla \times \vect{B}_1 &= \mu_0 \spec{\sum} \spec{\vecj}~,
	\end{aligned}
	\label{eq:maxwellEquations}
\end{gather}
where the index $s$ refers to the species of particles, i.e. proton or electron and $\spec{\sum}$ means that all species will be taken into account. For simplicity of the derivation the "s" index is dropped if not explicitly needed. The Maxwell's equations contain densities $n$ and currents $\vecj$ of the particles which can be expressed through the moments of the particle phase space distribution function $f$ as follows
\begin{gather}
	n(\x) = \ints \dvelo ~ f(\x, \velo) \\
	j_\parallel = Ze \ints \dvelo ~ \vpar f(\x, \velo) \qquad \vecj_\perp = Ze \ints \dvelo ~ \vperp f(\x, \velo)~.

\end{gather}
