In this chapter the following scheme will be discussed:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The Lagrangian $L$ for a particle in a electromagnetic field is reformulated in the fundamental one-form $\gamma$ according to 
        \begin{gather}
            \int \dt ~ L = \int \gamma~.
        \end{gather}
        From this point on the fundamental one-form and Lagrangian referes to the quantity $\gamma$. Then, the Lagrangian $\gamma$ will be transformed in the guiding center phase space and separated in its equilibrium and perturbated part. Through the Lie transformation the Lagrangian gets transformed into the gyrocenter phase space by eliminating the gyro phase. 
    \item Plugging the Lagrangian into the Euler-Lagrangian equation yields the equations of motions. From the equations of motion the Vlasov equation can be derived.
    \item The Vlasov equation solves for the density distribution function, which will be used to express the particle density $n$ and current $\vecj$ with the moments of the distribution function. 
    \item Particle density $n$ and current $\vecj$ will then be plugged into the Maxwell's equations, i.e. the field equations.
    \item The cancellation problem will be discussed and the mitigation technique will be introduced for {\gkw}.
\end{enumerate}

This chapter is based on the Dissertation of Tilman Dannert\cite{Dannert_PHD} and the derivation document provided by the {\gkw} group\cite{GKWDerivation}. The derivation of Faraday's law in Chapter \ref{sub:fieldEpar} is based on the disseration of Paul Crandall\cite{Crandall_PHD}.
