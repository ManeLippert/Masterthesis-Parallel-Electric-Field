  abstract = {Two key properties that are often used to define a plasma operating scenario in nuclear fusion tokamak devices are the current and electron temperature (Te) profiles due to their intimate relationship to plasma performance and stability. In the tokamak community, the current profile is typically specified in terms of the safety factor (q) profile or its inverse, the rotational transform (i = 1/q) profile. The plasma poloidal magnetic flux (Y) and Te dynamics are governed by an infinitedimensional, nonlinear, coupled, physics-based model that is described by the magnetic diffusion equation and the electron heat transport equation. In this work, an integrated feedback controller is designed to track target i (proportional to the spatial gradient of Y) and Te profiles by embedding these partial differential equation models into the control design process. The electron thermal conductivity profile is modeled as an uncertainty, and the controller is designed to be robust to an expected uncertainty range. The performance of the integrated i + Te profile controller in the TCV tokamak is demonstrated through simulations with the simulation code RAPTOR by first tracking a nominal target, and then modulating the Te profile between equilibrium points while maintaining the i profile in a stationary condition.},

In the regime where poloidal shearing exceeds turbulent radial scattering, a hybrid time scale weighted toward the former is found to govern the decorrelation process. The coupling between radial and poloidal decorrelation results in a suppression of the turbulence below its ambient value. The turbulence quench mechanism is found to be insensitive to the sign of either the radial electric field or its shear.},

Phys.\hphantom{,}186, 545 (2003)], a Eulerian gyrokinetic turbulence simulation code. In particular, the creation of entropy through spatial upwind dissipation (there is zero velocity-space dissipation in GYRO) and the reduction of entropy via the production of fluctuations are monitored in detail. This new diagnostic has yielded several key confirmations of the validity of the GYRO simulations. First, fluctuations balance dissipation in the ensemble-averaged sense, thus demonstrating that turbulent GYRO simulations achieve a true statistical steady state. Second, at the standard spatial grid size, neither entropy nor energy flux is significantly changed by a 16-fold increase (from 32 to 512 grid points per cell) in the number of grid points in the two-dimensional velocity space. Third, the measured flux is invariant to an eightfold increase in the upwind dissipation coefficients. A notable conclusion is that the lack of change in entropy with grid refinement refutes the familiar but incorrect notion that Eulerian gyrokinetic codes miss important velocity-space structure. The issues of density and energy conservation and their relation to negligible second-order effects such as the parallel nonlinearity are also discussed.},

  abstract = {The ballooning-mode eikonal representation is applied to the linearized incompressible magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations in axisymmetric systems with toroidal mass flows to obtain a set of initial value partial differential equations in which the time t and the poloidal angle t, are the independent variables. To derive these equations, the eikonal function S is assumed to satisfy the usual condition B * V S = 0 to guarantee that the modes vary slowly along the magnetic field. In addition?to resolve the V - V operator acting on perturbed quantities, the eikonal must also satisfy the condition dS/dt = 0. This induces a Doppler shift in S. In a flux coordinate system (s, 0, 4) with straight magnetic field lines, we have that S = 4--q(s)t,-R(s)t+k(s), where q, R and k are functions only of the radial coordinate s and represent the safety factor, the plasma rotation frequency and the radial wave number, respectively. This description of the instability, however, is incompatible with normal mode solutions of the MHD equations because the wave vector V S becomes time dependent when the velocity shear is finite. Nevertheless, we are able to investigate the effects of sheared toroidal flows on localized ballooning instabilities because the initial value formulation of the problem we have developed does not constrain the solutions to evolve as exp ( i o t ) . Fixed boundary MHD equilibria with isothermal toroidal flows that model the JET device are generated numerically with a variational inverse moments code. As the initial value equations are evolved in time, periodic bursts of ballooning activity are observed which are correlated with the formation of a ballooning structure at the outside edge of the torus that becomes displaced by 277 in the extended poloidal angle domain from one burst to the next. The frequency of these bursts depends only on the velocity shear and the instability growth rates extracted from the peak values of the bursts are virtually linear. The velocity shear has a stabilizing influence on plasma ballooning.},

These comparisons provide information on effects of differences in the physics content of the various models and on the fusion-relevant figures of merit of plasma performance predicted by the models. Many of the comparisons are undertaken for a simplified plasma model and geometry which is an idealization of the plasma conditions and geometry in a Doublet III-D [Plasma Physics and Controlled Nuclear Fusion Research, 1986 (International Atomic Energy Agency, Vienna, 1987), Vol. 1, p. 159] high confinement (H-mode) experiment. Most of the models show good agreements in their predictions and assumptions for the linear growth rates and frequencies. There are some differences associated with different equilibria. However, there are significant differences in the transport levels between the models. The causes of some of the differences are examined in some detail, with particular attention to numerical convergence in the turbulence simulations (with respect to simulation mesh size, system size and, for particle-based simulations, the particle number).

Using experimental beam-emission-spectroscopy measurements and gyrokinetic simulations, this symmetry breaking in ion-scale turbulence in MAST is shown to manifest itself as a tilt of the spatial correlation function and a finite skew in the distribution of the fluctuating density field. The tilt is a statistical expression of the `shearing' of the turbulent structures by the mean flow. The skewness of the distribution is related to the emergence of longlived density structures in sheared, near-marginal plasma turbulence. The extent to which these effects are pronounced is argued (with the aid of the simulations) to depend on the distance from the nonlinear stability threshold. Away from the threshold, the symmetry is effectively restored.},

The decay in the three-way interaction occurs to smaller and larger values of {\textbardbl}k{\textbardbl}. In a region of large wavenumbers this leads to the dual cascade; the energy spectrum cascades to smaller {\textbardbl}k{\textbardbl} and the enstrophy spectrum to larger {\textbardbl}k{\textbardbl}, similar to the case of two-dimensional Navier--Stokes turbulence. In a small wavenumber region a resonant three-wave decay process dominates the cascade process, and an anisotropic spectrum develops. As a consequence of the cascade, zonal flows in the direction perpendicular to the direction of inhomogeneity appear which presents a potential implication for the particle confinement in a turbulent plasma.},

In this study, we address this challenge by global, nonlinear gyrokinetic simulations of a full pedestal up to the separatrix, supported by a detailed characterisation of gyrokinetic instabilities from just inside the pedestal top to pedestal centre and foot. We present ASDEX Upgrade pedestal simulations using an upgraded version of the gyrokinetic, Eulerian, delta-f code GENE (genecode.org) that enables stable global simulations at experimental plasma {$\beta$} values. The turbulent transport is found to exhibit a multi-channel, multi-scale character throughout the pedestal with the dominant contribution transitioning from ion scale Trapped Electron Modes (TEMs)/Micro Tearing Modes (MTMs) at the pedestal top to electron scale Electron Temperature Gradient modes (ETG) in the steep gradient region. Consequently, the turbulent electron heat ux changes from ion to electron scales and the ion heat ux reduces to almost neoclassic values in the pedestal centre. E {\texttimes} B shear is found to strongly reduce heat ux levels in all channels (electron, ion, electrostatic, electromagnetic) and the interplay of magnetic shear and pressure gradient is found to locally stabilise ion scale instabilities.},

Such pattern formation has been observed in local gradient-driven flux-tube simulations as well as global gradient-driven and global flux-driven studies. To reduce the computational effort for the simulations lower input parameter of GKW (Gyro Kinetic Workshop) were tested to find the optimum of minimum resolution for the performed simulations. For convenience, a python script (slurm\_monitor.py) was written to monitor the simulation on the btrzx1-cluster and start/restart until the completion criterion is fulfilled. Furthermore, it is shown by multiple box size convergence scans that a mesoscale pattern size of {$\sim$} 57 - 76 {$\rho$} is inherent to ITG-driven turbulence with Cyclone Base Case parameters in the local limit. This outcome also implies that a typical scale for avalanche-like transport is inherent to ITG-driven turbulence.},

Spectral analyses of the ``triad'' entropy transfer function introduced in this study reveal not only the nonlinear interactions among the zonal and non-zonal modes, but also their effects on the turbulent transport level. Different types of the entropy transfer processes between the ITG and ETG turbulence are found: the entropy transfer from non-zonal to zonal modes is substantial in the saturation phase of the ITG instability, while, once the strong zonal flow is generated, the entropy transfer to the zonal modes becomes quite weak in the steady turbulence state. Instead, the zonal flows mediate the entropy transfer from non-zonal modes with low radial-wavenumbers (with contribution to the heat flux) to the other non-zonal modes with higher radial-wavenumbers (but with less contribution to the heat flux) through the triad interaction. The successive entropy transfer processes to the higher radial-wavenumber modes are associated with transport regulation in the steady turbulence state. In contrast, in both the instability-saturation and steady phases of the ETG turbulence, the entropy transfer processes among low-wavenumber non-zonal modes are dominant rather than the transfer via zonal modes.},

Consequently, the gradient driven local transport model is unable to accurately describe heat fluxes below Qi\&lt;10n0T0{$\rho$}*2vth, since no stationary fully developed turbulent state can be obtained. The turbulence in the flux driven case shows intermittent behaviour and avalanches for Qi\&lt;10n0T0{$\rho$}*2vth. Isolated avalanches disappear for Qi\&gt;10n0T0{$\rho$}*2vth, and at higher heat fluxes, the statistics of the turbulence is the same for the flux and gradient driven case. The nonlinear upshift of the temperature gradient length threshold for turbulence generation (known as the Dimits shift) is larger in the case of flux driven turbulence. This higher nonlinear upshift is attributed to the generation of structures in the radial temperature profile, known as staircases [Dif-Pradalier, Phys. Rev. E 82, 025401 (2010)]. Avalanches are initiated at specific locations and have roughly the same radial extent of 50--70 ion Larmor radii. The staircases are obtained at low heating rates, and become unstable and break up at higher heating rates. At the heat fluxes for which staircase formation is observed, no stationary gradient driven simulations can be obtained.},

  abstract = {Microturbulence close to marginality with inclusion of electron dynamics and in the electrostatic limit [A. Weikl et al., Phys. Plasmas 25, 072305 (2018)] is revisited. In such states the E ! B shearing rate xE!B, i.e., the second radial derivative of the zonal electrostatic potential, a quantity often applied to study zonal flow structure formation, has been found to be dominated by radial fine scale features. Those features are significantly different from the mesoscale E ! B staircase structures [G. Dif-Pradalier et al., Phys. Rev. E 82, 025401(R) (2010)] normally occurring close to the threshold. Instead of the E ! B shearing rate, here, zonal flow structure formation is studied through the zonal flow shear induced tilt of turbulent structures, which is measured by director field methods. In contrast to dominant fine scale features in xE!B, mesoscale zonal flow pattern formation on two disparate scales is identified: (i) A zonal flow with radial scale of the boxsize develops, (ii) superposed by zonal flow corrugations in form of shear layers emerging in the vicinity of lowest order rational layers. This mesoscale zonal flow pattern exhibits properties of E ! B staircases: (i) A shearing rate of  10\#1 vth;i=R0 (vth;i is the ion thermal velocity and R0 is the major radius), comparable to typical growth rates, can be attributed to both components of the mesoscale pattern. (ii) Avalanche-like turbulent transport events organize spatially on the same mesoscales. (iii) Shear stabilization by a background E ! B shear flow requires values of the background shearing rate exceeding those connected to the mesoscale pattern. In conclusion, this work demonstrates that E ! B staircases do develop, even when the E ! B shearing rate xE!B is dominated by radial fine scale features. The E ! B shearing rate xE!B, therefore, fails to estimate the shear provided by zonal flows when fine scale structures dominate its radial profile.},

The observed Doppler-shift due to the E{\texttimes}B velocity matches well with the measured turbulence group and phase velocities (in toroidally rotating neutral beam heated plasmas). Turbulence decorrelation rates are found to be {$\sim$}200\,kHz at the edge and to decrease toward the core (0.45\&lt;r/a\&lt;0.9) where they approach the E{\texttimes}B shearing rate ({$\sim$}50\,kHz). Radial and poloidal correlation lengths are found to scale with the ion gyroradius and exhibit an asymmetric poloidally elongated eddy structure. The ensemble-averaged turbulent eddy structure changes its tilt with respect to the radial-poloidal coordinates in the core, consistent with an E{\texttimes}B shear mechanism. The 2D spatial correlation and wavenumber spectra [S(kr,k{\texttheta})] are presented and compared to nonlinear flux-tube GYRO simulations at two radii, r/a=0.5 and r/a=0.75, showing reasonable overall agreement, but the GYRO spectrum exhibits a peak at finite kr for r/a=0.75 that is not observed experimentally; E{\texttimes}B shear may cause this discrepancy.},

This instability is the coherent hydrodynamic generalization of the resonant type mean flow instability identified recently [P. H. Diamond, M. N. Rosenbluth, F. L. Hinton, M. Malkov, J. Fleischer, and A. Smolyakov, 17th IAEA Fusion Energy Conference, IAEA-CN-69/TH3/1, Yokohama, 1998 (to be published, International Atomic Energy Agency, Vienna)]. The mechanism discussed here, along with the resonant type, constitutes the ``hydrodynamic'' and ``kinetic'' regimes of the same process, similar to the case of plasma-beam instabilities. It is suggested that this generic mechanism is responsible for the generation of mean flow in atmospheres of rotating planets and magnetized plasmas.},

Fluids B 4, 3138 (1992)]. The higher moments are truncated in terms of the lower moments (density, parallel velocity, and parallel and perpendicular pressure) by modeling the deviation from a perturbed Maxwellian to fit the kinetic response function at all values of the kinetic parameters: k{$\parallel$}vth/{$\omega$}, b=(k{$\perp\rho$})2/2, and {$\omega$}D/{$\omega$}. Here the resulting gyro-Landau fluid equations are applied to the simulation of ion temperature gradient (ITG) mode turbulence in toroidal geometry using a novel three-dimensional (3-D) nonlinear ballooning mode representation. The representation is a Fourier transform of a field line following basis (ky{$\prime$},kx{$\prime$},z{$\prime$}) with periodicity in toroidal and poloidal angles. Particular emphasis is given to the role of nonlinearly generated n=0 (ky{$\prime$} = 0, kx{$\prime$} {$\neq$} 0) ``radial modes'' in stabilizing the transport from the finite-n ITG ballooning modes. Detailing the parametric dependence of toroidal ITG turbulence is a key result.},

E. Waltz, G. D. Kerbel, and J. Milovich, Phys. Plasmas 1, 2229 (1994)]. The present paper extends this work by treating some unresolved issues concerning ITG turbulence with adiabatic electrons. Although eddies are highly elongated in the radial direction, long time radial correlation lengths are short and comparable to poloidal lengths. Although transport at vanishing shear is not particularly large, transport at reverse global shear, is significantly less. Electrostatic transport at moderate shear is not much affected by inclusion of local shear and average favorable curvature. Transport is suppressed when critical E{\texttimes}B rotational shear is comparable to the maximum linear growth rate with only a weak dependence on magnetic shear. Self-consistent turbulent transport of toroidal momentum can result in a transport bifurcation at sufficiently large r/(Rq). However, the main thrust of the new formulation in the paper deals with advances in the development of finite beta GLF models with trapped electrons and BMR numerical methods for treating the fast parallel field motion of the untrapped electrons.},

Plasmas 1, 2229 (1994)]. The present work revisits the flux tube simulations reformulated in terms of Floquet ballooning modes which convect in the ballooning mode angle.

The linear eigenmodes can be linearly stable at small E{\texttimes}B shear rates, yet Floquet mode convective amplification allows turbulence to persist unless the critical shear rate is exceeded. The flux tube simulations and the {$\gamma$}E-crit{$\approx\gamma$}0 quench rule are valid only at vanishing relative gyroradius. Modifications and limits of validity on the quench rule are suggested from analyzing the finite relative gyroradius ``ballooning-Schr{\"o}dinger equation'' [R. L. Dewar, Plasma Phys.

  abstract = {This paper confirms that E{\texttimes}B shearing from toroidally symmetric (toroidal mode number n=0) ``radial modes'' provides the dominant nonlinear saturation mechanism for drift wave (n{$\neq$}0) turbulence, which in turn nonlinearly drives the modes. In common usage, this is loosely referred to as the ``drift wave--zonal flow paradigm'' for nonlinear saturation despite the fact that radial modes have several components distinguished in this paper: a residual or zero mean frequency ``zonal flow'' part and an oscillatory ``geodesic acoustic mode'' (GAM) part. Linearly, the zonal flows (and GAMs) are weakly damped only by ion-ion collisions, while the GAMs are strongly Landau damped only at low safety factor q. At high q the Hinton--Rosenbluth residual flow from an impulse vanishes and only the weakly damped GAMs remain. With the linear physics and driving rates of the finite-n transport modes unchanged, this paper argues that GAMs are only somewhat less effective than the residual zonal flows in providing the nonlinear saturation, and in some cases E{\texttimes}B shearing from GAMs (or at least the GAM physics) appears to dominate: transport appears to be nearly linear in the GAM frequency. By deleting the drift wave--drift wave nonlinear coupling, it is found that drift wave--radial mode nonlinear coupling triads account for most of the nonlinear saturation. Furthermore, the E{\texttimes}B shear components of the radial modes nonlinearly stabilize the finite-n modes, while the diamagnetic components nonlinearly destabilize them. Finally, from wave number spectral contour plots of the time average nonlinear entropy transfer function (and rates), it is shown that the peak in entropy generation coincides with the peak in transport production, while entropy dissipation (like Landau damping) is spread equally over all n modes (including n=0). Most of these conclusions appear to hold about equally well for all types of drift wave turbulence.},

The present simulation on the zonal flow and the geodesic acoustic mode (GAM) successfully reproduces the neoclassical polarization of trapped ions as well as ballistic mode structures produced by collisionless particle motions. During the collisionless damping of GAM, the finer-scale structures of the ion distribution function in the velocity--space continue to develop while preserving an invariant defined by a sum of an entropy variable and the potential energy. The simulation results of the toroidal ITG turbulent transport clearly show generation of the fine velocity--space structures of the distribution function and their collisional dissipation. Detailed calculation of the entropy balance confirms the statistically steady state of turbulence, where the anomalous transport balances with the dissipation are given by the weak collisionality. The above results obtained by simulations with high velocity--space resolution are also understood in terms of generation, transfer and dissipation processes of the entropy variable in the phase--space.},

  abstract = {The dependence of the heat flux on the temperature gradient length in collisionless ion temperature gradient turbulence has recently been revisited. It has been found that the heat flux is discontinuous at a finite heat flux threshold larger than the (Dimits) interpolated threshold. In this paper, the influence of collisions on the heat flux close to the threshold is investigated. It is found that up to relatively high collision frequencies, relevant to the modern day experiments, a discontinuous behaviour of the heat flux as a function of the gradient length persists. Collisions, however, do lead to a reduction in the gradient length at which the discontinuity is observed. Below the finite heat flux threshold, a state of low turbulence with a vanishing small heat flux persists, which can drive the zonal flow against the collisional dissipation. This state is characterised by the fully developed staircases in the radial ExB shearing profile. Increasing the collision frequency at a fixed gradient length leads to the loss of the fully developed staircase structure with the ExB shearing profile having the form of a sawtooth that allows for avalanche formation and a finite heat flux. At very high collision frequencies or gradient lengths well above the threshold the staircase structure is lost. The simulations indicate that the long wave length zonal flow saturates through a mechanism that directly involves the turbulence intensity.},
