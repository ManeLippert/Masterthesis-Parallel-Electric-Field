\section{Gyrokinetic Workshop ({\gkw})}
\label{sec:gkw}

The gyrokinetic simulations of this thesis will be performend with the nonlinear local (flux-tube) version of the Gyrokinetic Workshop ({\gkw}). In this version GKW solves the gyrokinetic equation for the modified distribution function $g$ [Ch. \ref{sub:cancelProblem}] and uses the field aligned Hamada coordinates\cite{Hamada1962} with the coordinate set $\{s,~\psi,~\zeta,~\vpar,~\mu\}$. Here, $s$ parameterizes the length along th field lines, $\psi$ is the radial coordinate (noramlized by $\rhoth$) and $\zeta$ represents the approximately the binormal coordinate. To read more about the code {\gkw} the reader is referred to Ref. \citenum{Peeters2009A} or to the manual\cite{GKWManual} in the bitbucket repository.

The simulations itself were perforemd on the \code{emil}\cite{emil} cluster and the cluster \code{festus}\cite{festus} of the University Bayreuth or on one of the \code{btppx} machines of the TPV Chair.
