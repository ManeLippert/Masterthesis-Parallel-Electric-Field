In this thesis the cancellation problem gets investigated and one technique to mitigate it was implemented in the local (flux-tube) version of {\gkw}, the Faraday law. In process of the replacement {\gkw} was transformed from the so called g-version to the new f-version, which enables new possiblities to calculate dignostics. 

Experimental Ending !!!

During the benchmark of the f-version of {\gkw} it was found that the cancellation problem could not be mitigated. Further researches about the mitigation technique shows that the mitigation only appears in the global nonlinear cases. Which mechanism are relevant will be from now one part of the upcoming research.
