In this thesis the cancellation problem gets investigated and one technique to mitigate it was implemented in the local (flux-tube) version of {\gkw}. This mitigation technique introduces an additional electomagnetic field though Faraday's law. In process of the implementation, {\gkw} was transformed from the so called g-version to the new f-version, which calculates directly the unmodified distribution function. \bigskip

During the benchmark of the f-version of {\gkw} it was found that the cancellation problem could not be mitigated with the same technique in local linear simulations. The nonlinear benchmark shows a trend that the implementation is valid but no further asssumptions could be made.
