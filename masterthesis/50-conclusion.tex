In this thesis the cancellation problem is investigated and a technique to mitigate it was implemented in the local (flux-tube) version of {\gkw}. This mitigation technique introduces an additional electomagnetic field through Faraday's law, the plasma induction $\Epar$. During the implementation process, {\gkw} was transformed from the so called g-version to the new f-version, which directly calculates the unmodified distribution function. This f-version will be used for future investigation of the cancellation problem in the global version of {\gkw}. \bigskip

During the benchmark of the f-version of {\gkw} it was found that the cancellation problem could not be mitigated with the same technique in local linear simulations. The nonlinear benchmark shows a trend that the implementation is valid but no further asssumptions could be made with the data available in this thesis. Further investigations into the nonlinear f-version might yield a solution to the cancellation problem in local simulations.
